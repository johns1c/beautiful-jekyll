# Join us as a member

## Reasons to join

Support a local club.  Enjoy the outdoors and playing with water is always fun.  Develop strength and skills.  Membership gives a chance to use COPS kit. 

## Classes of membership

Membership is open to those who paddle with us, their family and other supporters.  We have three classes of members

*    Adult paddlers
*    Youth paddlers
*    Parents and other supporters

## Cost

Our aim is to ensure that kyacking is accesible to all.  

At the moment we are not charging for membership but will charge for sessions in order to cover our direct costs.  

Charges will be reinstated in the new year when we have a better idea of our outgoings.
